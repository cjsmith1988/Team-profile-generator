### User Story:

AS A manager

I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info

SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

### Requirements:

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information

THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML

THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

WHEN I click on the GitHub username

THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

WHEN I start the application

THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

WHEN I select the engineer option

THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

WHEN I select the intern option
